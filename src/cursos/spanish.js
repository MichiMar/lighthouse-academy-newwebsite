          We do everything in Spanish! Our delight is to have children repeat
          and respond in Spanish. Our teachers are professionals who know how to
          engage the children so that they will speak Spanish. Great care is put
          into the selection of activities and the environment to make our
          Spanish immersion program successful. Children learn phrases as they
          learn to communicate their needs and desires through interactive
          games, songs, routines and fun activities. It is amazing to see little
          children of American and Chinese households speak with native Spanish
          accents all they need to communicate. Our staff members are fluent
          Spanish speakers, so the possibilities for learning Spanish are
          endless!
