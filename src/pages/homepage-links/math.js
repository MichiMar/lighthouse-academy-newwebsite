          Students first work with concrete activities and then progress
          gradually towards abstract concepts. Work may include arithmetic,
          fractions, geometry, and algebra. Math begins with simple number
          recognition, and is later followed by complex equations.

          The process is taught first, and the facts later. Our program is set
          up to help develop a sense of order, coordination, concentration, and
          independence. Numbers through ten, decimal system, linear and skip
          counting, tables of arithmetic, abstract equations, fractions.

          Our Montessori classes consist of lessons that help students
          understand and know how to use math, versus just memorizing and
          regurgitating meaningless facts. Maria Montessori, a doctor with great
          understanding of human brain development, and an inquisitive learner
          of physical science herself, developed a math philosophy and
          curriculum that has been embraced by everyone.

          During class time, children may choose to work in groups or
          individually. The teacher, called "guide" hels the students use
          materials and math games.

          Math is fascinating. Sadly, because of negative past emotional
          experiences, some people hate it. But it need not be that way! The
          math concepts we are taught developed as we humans tried to come up
          with a tool to understand the natural world around us. If we take a
          hold of math as that, as a tool that can help us discover and
          understand, there will be fun in place of trauma.

          For example, upon reading that there are only about 400 Siberian
          tigers left in the wild, young child uses the Montessori golden bead
          material to visualize how many 400 units looks like.

          The concrete Montessori materials are meant to help children, and
          often adults, make sense of math, and walk the child from the concrete
          to the abstract. It is important to let the child lead, making
          invitations to interact and play together, and creating a positive
          environment, children are bound to enjoy it! Here's an intro to this
          philosophy. Montessori children enjoy math!

          Each child's progress is tracked, and presentations of new concepts
          are given according to the child's readiness. Montessori math in the
          elementary level is truly comprehensive. For example, it includes the
          decimal system, all fraction equations, long and short division and
          multiplication, square roots, cubing, Pythagoras theorem, geometry,
          trigonometry, and algebra.

          Our Montessori early childhood (ages 2-6) class are designed to help
          spark the child's interest and understanding in areas of numbers to
          ten, decimal system, linear and skip counting, tables of arithmetic,
          passage to abstraction and fractions. <br />
